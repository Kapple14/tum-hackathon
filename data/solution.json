        "question": "How can I control the height of a pattern element in the layout to be a specific size, independent of the drawing scale, in Allplan 2020?",
        "answer": "To control the height of a pattern element in the layout to be a specific size independent of the drawing scale in Allplan 2020, you should use the **\"Constant in layout\" pattern setting**.\n\nWith this setting, the size of pattern elements remains the same regardless of the scale. To achieve your desired height, you need to:\n\n1. **Determine the pattern's default height** - Check the pattern defaults for your chosen pattern (for example, pattern 301 might have a default height of 100 mm)\n\n2. **Calculate the required factor** - Divide your desired height by the default height. For instance, if you want a pattern element height of 10 mm and the default is 100 mm, you would calculate: 10 mm ÷ 100 mm = 0.10\n\n3. **Enter the factor in pattern parameters** - Input this factor (0.10 in the example) in the pattern parameters\n\nUsing this approach, the pattern element will maintain the same height in the layout at both 1:50 and 1:100 scales, or any other scale. The calculation is: **pattern height × factor = height of one pattern element in layout**, and this result remains constant regardless of scale.",

        "context": "186 Pattern and scale Allplan 2020 Representation in layout The size of the pattern elements is the same at 1:50 as at 1:100, but the number of pattern elements doubles. The size is based on the value entered in the pattern defaults and on the width/height factor, which is defined in the pattern parameters. For example : You use pattern 301 and the height of one pattern element should be 10 mm in the layout. In the pattern defaults, a height of 100 mm is defined for pattern 301. Therefore, you must enter a factor of 0.10 in the pattern parameters (pattern height x factor = height of one pattern element in the layout). This returns a height of 10 mm (100 mm x 10), regardless of the scale. Representation in document As the number of pattern elements doubles, the way the pattern looks in documents changes dynamically with the reference scale.\n\nInstallation, Basics Applying surface elements 187 “Adjust to scale in layout” pattern setting When you select Adjust to scale in layout , the size of the pattern elements in the layout changes dynamically with the scale at which the layout elements have been placed. Components like walls are based on this setting. Patterns in layouts look different from patterns in documents. It is the way hatching looks in layouts that is of relevance. Representation in layout The size of the pattern elements is twice as large at 1:50 as at 1:100, but the number of pattern elements remains constant. The size of a single pattern element depends on the following settings: the value in the pattern defaults, the height/width factor specified in the pattern parameters and the scale at which the layout element was placed. For example : You use pattern 301 and the height of one pattern element in the layout should be 10 mm in the layout. In the pattern defaults, a height of 100 mm is defined for pattern 301. Therefore, you must enter a factor of 10 in the pattern parameters (height of a pattern element in the layout = pattern height defined in the defaults x factor x layout scale). At a scale of 1:100, the height is 10 mm (100 mm x 10 x 1/100); at a scale of 1:50, the height is 20 mm.

In Allplan you usually select the edit tool (for example, copy) first and then the elements to which you want to apply this tool. This also works the other way round in most edit tools: Select the elements first and then the tool. You can select elements either by clicking them or by defining a region around the elements you want to select. The tools in the Work Environment area of the Actionbar , the selection shortcut menu and the Filter Assistant toolbar help you select elements. Tip: When you right-click an element and select an edit tool on the shortcut menu, Allplan selects the element automatically.\n\n124 Selecting elements, overview Allplan 2020 This table gives you an overview of selection options: To do this Do this Select an element. Click the element. Select several elements or regions. Open the Brackets , click the elements or specify the regions. Then close the brackets. You can also open and close these metaphorical brackets by right-clicking in the workspace. Select elements in a region. To specify a selection rectangle: Use the left mouse button to open a selection rectangle. In the Optio ns - Desktop environment - Selection page - Selection area, you can specify that closing the selection rectangle requires a second click. When working with the selection rectangle, you can specify whether you want to select elements fully bounded by the region, fully bounded and intersected or intersected elements only. To specify a fence : Click Fence and enter the points defining the outline of the fence. Select all elements. In the case of some tools (for example, Export ), you can select all the elements in the current document by clicking All in the input options. This also selects elements that are not visible such as default reference planes. See also \"Behavior of default planes when copying or moving elements between documents\" in the Allplan Help. Reselect the elements that were selected last. Click Reselect (Actionbar – Work Environment area or Filter Assistant toolbar). Select elements with the same group number. Click one of the elements in the group with the middle mouse button and then left mouse button. Alternatively, select and hold the Shift key.\n\n126 Selecting elements, overview Allplan 2020 Selecting elements by entering a region You can also select elements by specifying a region rather than clicking elements. When you use the selection rectangle, you can specify whether you want to select elements fully bounded by the region, fully bounded and intersected or intersected elements only. The Selection area of the Actionbar and the Filter Assistant toolbar provide the following options: • Selects the elements that are fully bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selects the elements that are fully or partially bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selects the elements that are partially bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selection depends on the direction in which you enter the selection rectangle: - Entering the region in the positive x-direction selects elements that are fully bounded by the region only. - Entering the region in the negative x-direction selects all the elements that are fully or partially bounded by the region. With this method, the selection rectangle is shown as dashed lines. Note: Select elements based on direction is the default. The selection rectangle is a colored area, which is indicated by the icons. The color of the area changes with the selection option you activate. The easiest way to enter the region is to select and hold the left mouse button and to enter two points that define diagonally opposite corners of a selection rectangle. You can also use Fence to enter a freeform region.",

        "context": "Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 241 To do this, you can use the extensive shortcut menu of the Layers palette. • The Objects palette - Sort by layer criterion also shows the current layer. You can change the layer status by clicking the icon indicating the layer status. You can see all the layers in the documents loaded. The tree structure lists all layers with their elements sorted by element group. • If a tool (for example, Line) is active, you can use the Properties palette to define a different layer as the current one. This layer will then automatically be used as the current layer the next time you activate the tool. • When you save components as styles or favorite files, the program also saves the current layer. When you retrieve these components later, the layer saved automatically becomes the current layer. • Normally, openings like recesses in walls and slabs or window and door openings get the same layer as the element into which they are inserted. Click the Special button in the Options - Components and architecture - Miscellaneous area to specify whether these openings can be assigned separate, independent layers. • As walls can consist of multiple construction layers and each layer can have different format properties, you can define the layer for each of the construction layers in a wall or upstand directly in the Properties dialog box (you usually make these settings in the Properties palette).\n\nInstallation, Basics Structuring and managing data 227 Creating a building structure You can create a building structure in several ways: • You can create the building structure by using floor manager. If you use this method, you can create the building structure and the objects derived from the building structure in one go. At the same time, you can assign height settings to the structural levels. • You can configure the program to create the building structure automatically the first time you open the Building structure tab. If you use this method, you can select a building structure that comes with Allplan. • You can create the building structure by using the building structure wizard. Using structural levels to apply a logical structure to a building By means of structural levels, you can apply a logical structure to a building. You can assign one or more drawing files to each structural level. There are two different types of structural levels: • Predefined structural levels : Predefined structural levels can only be used in their hierarchical sequence. For example, a structure cannot be subordinate to a building. However, structural levels can be left out (for example, a building can be subordinate to a project). The following five predefined structural levels are available (in this hierarchy): - Site - Structure - Building - Story - Substory • Any structural levels : in addition, you can use custom structural levels, which you can insert anywhere in the building structure. Click Restrictions of building structure on the shortcut menu of a project to specify which structural levels can be used in the building structure and which structural levels can be assigned drawing files.\n\nInstallation, Basics Structuring and managing data 217 Overview of projects, building structure, drawing files and layouts A project is an organizational unit. When you work in Allplan in a project-based manner, a new project is created for each construction project. Technically, a project is a folder; metaphorically speaking, it is a drawer containing the drawing files. An unnamed private project for practice and testing is available to each user. You use the building structure to organize the data of a project. This way, you use hierarchical levels to logically structure a building, thus forming the basis for a Building Information Model (BIM). Each structural level gets drawing files and default planes defining the height of the components belonging to the structural level in question. You can derive and create sections, views and reports directly from the building structure. In addition, you can assemble up to 128 drawing files in a fileset; a project can contain up to 1,000 filesets. A fileset can be placed in a layout with a single command. The actual design and data creation process happens in drawing files. These are the equivalent of the transparencies used in conventional building design. Drawing files can be used to give projects a structure. In IT terms, a drawing file is a conventional file stored on your hard disk. You can display and edit up to 128 drawing files at once - in other words, you can have several files open simultaneously. A project can contain up to 9999 drawing files. When working without layers, the individual building elements (such as walls, stairs, labeling, etc.) are drawn on different drawing files and superimposed like transparencies. Layers provide an additional means of applying a structure - within documents. They apply to all the drawing files in a project. Design entities and components can automatically be assigned to the correct layer. Layers can be set so that they are not visible to the user.",

A wizard is a pictogram-like legend representing tools you use frequently. In addition, you can use wizards to work with predefined content. You can match all attributes and parameters of elements from the wizard. You do not need to define any element properties. Right -clicking an element opens a shortcut menu with the following options: • The tool that was used to create the element is at the top of the shortcut menu. The element gets the most recent properties; it does not take the parameters and attributes from the wizard. • By clicking Match , you open the tool that was used to create the element. In addition, you take all the parameters and attributes from the wizard. This is equivalent to double-clicking the element with the right mouse button. • Conversion for Building Alteration Work is available for most architectural elements. This matches the building alteration category of the element clicked. If you have not assigned a building alteration category, Allplan automatically uses the New building category. Allplan comes with several predefined wizard files, but you can also create your own wizards. You can find the predefined wizards in the \\ETC\\Assistent folder. In addition, you can purchase wizards with content. • You can save drawing files and NDW files as wizards. To do this, click the Allplan icon , select Save copy as and the Wizard (*.nas) file type. • You can save wizards as NDW files or drawing files.

        "context": "268 IFC interface Allplan 2020 IFC object type You can use the IFC object type (IfcObjectType) attribute to change the IFC classification of components. This is particularly important if you cannot find an appropriate Allplan tool to create a component and thus model the component as a 3D object or a user-defined architectural component. Note: Only use the IFC object type attribute if you need it. IFC object type exports the element as a BREP (surface model). Normally, Allplan elements will be assigned automatically to the appropriate IFC classes (walls, columns, .). If the IFC object type assigned matches the native Allplan element type, the program ignores the assignment, trying to transfer the element not as a BRep. This prevents loss of quality during IFC export. Note: IFC export transfers openings in the following components: wall (IfcWall), downstand beam and upstand beam (IfcBeam), column (IfcColumn), slab (IfcSlab), roof (IfcRoof), foundation (IfcFooting), and BuildingElementProxy. If a different IFC object type is assigned to the component (for example, IfcPlate instead of IfcSlab), openings will not be transferred. Use the Modify Attributes tool to assign the IFC object type (IfcObjectType) attribute to this component and select the appropriate IFC classification afterward. The most commonly used 21 IFC elements are predefined and can be selected directly in the drop-down list. If you cannot find the required element, click any entry and enter the name of the missing element at the keyboard. The program saves the new entry, presenting it again the next time you select attributes. You can find detailed information on all IFC object types and IFC object subtypes in the appendix of the Allplan BIM compendium, which you can download as a PDF file from the Allplan home page (http://www.allplan.com/en).

The new interface creates data in the following formats: IFC 4, IFC XML 4, IFC 2x3, and IFC XML 2x3. The export log sorts elements that cannot be transferred by problem category and IFC object type, listing the elements with the Name and Allright_Component_ID attributes. Note: The Export IFC Data tools considers the visibility settings of layers . If, for example, you want to transfer the load-bearing layer of a wall to IFC, hide the Allplan layers of all other wall layers before you export the data. IFC BaseQuantities BaseQuantities are dimensions and values calculated from the geometry of the model. You can transfer BaseQuantities with exchange partners. You can transfer IFC BaseQuantities with the following settings: • Select Export IFC Data , open the Settings and select the Transfer quantities data option in the Advanced options area. • The Export IFC 2x3 Data tool only transfers BaseQuantities if the Certified CV2.0 data export option is not selected in the Advanced options area in the Settings . Note: IFC Export considers BaseQuantities of the following components: user-defined architectural elements, openings, windows, doors, railings, columns, roofs, and foundations.

The Selection area of the Actionbar and the Filter Assistant toolbar provide the following options: • Selects the elements that are fully bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selects the elements that are fully or partially bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selects the elements that are partially bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selection depends on the direction in which you enter the selection rectangle: - Entering the region in the positive x-direction selects elements that are fully bounded by the region only. - Entering the region in the negative x-direction selects all the elements that are fully or partially bounded by the region. With this method, the selection rectangle is shown as dashed lines. Note: Select elements based on direction is the default. The selection rectangle is a colored area, which is indicated by the icons. The color of the area changes with the selection option you activate. The easiest way to enter the region is to select and hold the left mouse button and to enter two points that define diagonally opposite corners of a selection rectangle. You can also use Fence to enter a freeform region.\n\n124 Selecting elements, overview Allplan 2020 This table gives you an overview of selection options: To do this Do this Select an element. Click the element. Select several elements or regions. Open the Brackets , click the elements or specify the regions. Then close the brackets. You can also open and close these metaphorical brackets by right-clicking in the workspace. Select elements in a region. To specify a selection rectangle: Use the left mouse button to open a selection rectangle. In the Optio ns - Desktop environment - Selection page - Selection area, you can specify that closing the selection rectangle requires a second click. When working with the selection rectangle, you can specify whether you want to select elements fully bounded by the region, fully bounded and intersected or intersected elements only. To specify a fence : Click Fence and enter the points defining the outline of the fence. Select all elements. In the case of some tools (for example, Export ), you can select all the elements in the current document by clicking All in the input options. This also selects elements that are not visible such as default reference planes. See also \"Behavior of default planes when copying or moving elements between documents\" in the Allplan Help. Reselect the elements that were selected last. Click Reselect (Actionbar – Work Environment area or Filter Assistant toolbar). Select elements with the same group number. Click one of the elements in the group with the middle mouse button and then left mouse button. Alternatively, select and hold the Shift key.\n\nInstallation, Basics Precision drawing 135 Using drawing aids and a cursor snap angle When you draw linear elements (a wall or a line, for example), you can draw freely or you can restrict the direction in which you draw to a specific angle. You can make this setting on the right side of the dialog line. You can restrict movement to horizontal and vertical (enter at right angles) or enter a cursor snap angle of your choice. The program considers the current setting for the system angle. If, for example, the system angle is 30°, then this is interpreted as being horizontal. Note : A cursor snap angle has priority over any point snap settings, as well as any other settings on the shortcut menu. This means that only points in alignment with one of the cursor snap angles will be snapped.

The relevant properties are then grayed out in the Properties palette and Modify Format Properties dialog box. For more information, see Defining format properties based on layers (on page 121). Advantages of the “from layer” format property • The elements' format properties are linked with the layers' format properties.

The input options provide numerous tools that help you place elements. Note : You cannot use the clipboard when you define patterns and fonts. Allplan features You can use the clipboard in Allplan just as you would in any other Windows application. Note, however, that there are some special elements and properties: • Layer : Elements retain their layers. Elements on frozen layers (visible and hidden) will not be copied. • Default planes : You must use Ctrl+A to select default planes. See also \"Behavior of default planes when copying or moving elements between documents\" in the Allplan Help. • Group number : Elements get new group numbers when you place them. Elements that had the same group numbers still have the same group numbers. • Document size : The program displays an error message if the file size is too large after you have inserted elements. • Texts : If the application from which you have copied texts to the clipboard is an OLE server (such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel), the contents of the clipboard will be pasted as an OLE object into Allplan. To paste the contents of the clipboard as normal text, use Paste Contents – Unformatted (Unicode) Text . Text of this kind gets the current text parameters. • FEA and Allfa elements : FEA and Allfa elements cannot be copied to the clipboard.\n\n258 DWG, DXF, DGN interfaces Allplan 2020 • Import the data. Then, move the data toward the origin by using the Move tool in Allplan. • Define offset coordinates in the Project Settings . Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. Important Using an offset is usually the better solution: • Point coordinates are measured correctly, and they do not change. This is particularly important when you need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). • Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. • Whenever you move data, you change the coordinates themselves. Use this option only if you want to work with this data only in your office and you do not need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). If a project with large coordinates is at an advanced stage, Allplan provides another solution that helps you enhance the representation of this data. • Open the Options on the Desktop environment page and select the Optimize working with large coordinates option. Allplan optimizes the coordinates of the elements internally, restoring the original values each time you save the data, for example. Adjusting units and lengths During conversion, you can use three parameters to control how the program adjusts the units in the source system to the units in the destination system. Depending on the source system and destination system, you might not be able to change the Unit and Layout scale parameters. By using the Resizing factor , however, you can always adjust the units.\n\nInstallation, Basics Precision drawing 149 Transferring values to boxes by clicking Boxes provide shortcut menus, which you can use to get values from the drawing by clicking.

A wizard is a pictogram-like legend representing tools you use frequently. In addition, you can use wizards to work with predefined content. You can match all attributes and parameters of elements from the wizard. You do not need to define any element properties.

The element gets the most recent properties; it does not take the parameters and attributes from the wizard. • By clicking Match , you open the tool that was used to create the element. In addition, you take all the parameters and attributes from the wizard. This is equivalent to double-clicking the element with the right mouse button. • Conversion for Building Alteration Work is available for most architectural elements. This matches the building alteration category of the element clicked. If you have not assigned a building alteration category, Allplan automatically uses the New building category. Allplan comes with several predefined wizard files, but you can also create your own wizards. You can find the predefined wizards in the \\ETC\\Assistent folder. In addition, you can purchase wizards with content. • You can save drawing files and NDW files as wizards.

The input options provide numerous tools that help you place elements. Note : You cannot use the clipboard when you define patterns and fonts. Allplan features You can use the clipboard in Allplan just as you would in any other Windows application. Note, however, that there are some special elements and properties: • Layer : Elements retain their layers. Elements on frozen layers (visible and hidden) will not be copied. • Default planes : You must use Ctrl+A to select default planes. See also \"Behavior of default planes when copying or moving elements between documents\" in the Allplan Help. • Group number : Elements get new group numbers when you place them. Elements that had the same group numbers still have the same group numbers. • Document size : The program displays an error message if the file size is too large after you have inserted elements. • Texts : If the application from which you have copied texts to the clipboard is an OLE server (such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel), the contents of the clipboard will be pasted as an OLE object into Allplan. To paste the contents of the clipboard as normal text, use Paste Contents – Unformatted (Unicode) Text . Text of this kind gets the current text parameters. • FEA and Allfa elements : FEA and Allfa elements cannot be copied to the clipboard.\n\n124 Selecting elements, overview Allplan 2020 This table gives you an overview of selection options: To do this Do this Select an element. Click the element. Select several elements or regions. Open the Brackets , click the elements or specify the regions. Then close the brackets. You can also open and close these metaphorical brackets by right-clicking in the workspace. Select elements in a region. To specify a selection rectangle: Use the left mouse button to open a selection rectangle. In the Optio ns - Desktop environment - Selection page - Selection area, you can specify that closing the selection rectangle requires a second click. When working with the selection rectangle, you can specify whether you want to select elements fully bounded by the region, fully bounded and intersected or intersected elements only. To specify a fence : Click Fence and enter the points defining the outline of the fence. Select all elements. In the case of some tools (for example, Export ), you can select all the elements in the current document by clicking All in the input options. This also selects elements that are not visible such as default reference planes. See also \"Behavior of default planes when copying or moving elements between documents\" in the Allplan Help.

        "context": "Installation, Basics Precision drawing 135 Using drawing aids and a cursor snap angle When you draw linear elements (a wall or a line, for example), you can draw freely or you can restrict the direction in which you draw to a specific angle. You can make this setting on the right side of the dialog line. You can restrict movement to horizontal and vertical (enter at right angles) or enter a cursor snap angle of your choice. The program considers the current setting for the system angle. If, for example, the system angle is 30°, then this is interpreted as being horizontal. Note : A cursor snap angle has priority over any point snap settings, as well as any other settings on the shortcut menu. This means that only points in alignment with one of the cursor snap angles will be snapped. You can use the following options in the dialog line to restrict cursor movement to a specific direction or angle: Icon Tool Use No icon pressed in The line can be drawn at any angle. This is the default setting. Enter at right angles The line can be drawn only at right angles to the current system angle. Cursor snap The line can be drawn only at specific angles. 15.00 Cursor snap angle Define the cursor snap angle here (only possible when is turned on).\n\nInstallation, Basics Precision drawing 139 Linear snap Use Linear snap to place points so that they are in direct alignment with existing points. To do this, use Ctrl+left mouse button. If the program finds a point within the snap radius, it places the point in such a manner that it is exactly aligned with the nearest point found inside the snap radius. Alignment is based on the selected system angle. If the Display CursorTips - Linear snap option is selected in the Point snap representation area of the Point snap options , the program highlights the points that are in perpendicular alignment before you select a button and creates temporary construction lines stretching to the point. This provides a better visual check when you use the linear snap tool. (A) Crosshairs (B) Snap radius (1) Linear snap (2) Point snapped Tip: Drafting with linear snap is mainly useful with drawings consisting of few design entities. It becomes more difficult to align with the correct point as the number of design entities increases.\n\n136 Basics Allplan 2020 Snapping to points While you are placing a point with the left mouse button, you can snap to points on existing elements. You can snap to the following types of points: end points, midpoints, division points and points of intersection. You do not need to know the coordinates of these points, nor is it necessary to work with construction lines. When CursorTips are selected, a symbol (known as a CursorTip) appears at the center of the crosshairs. The CursorTip shows the kind of point that has been detected in the snap radius. By using the Options - Desktop environment - Point snap , you can define the types of points the system is to snap and whether the system is to scan active, edit or reference drawing files for points. By means of linear snap, you can align points exactly with existing points. Here, too, visual aids help you do this. Note : A cursor snap angle has priority over any point snap settings, as well as any other settings you define in the design aids . This means that only points in alignment with one of the cursor snap angles will be snapped.",

Then, move the data toward the origin by using the Move tool in Allplan. • Define offset coordinates in the Project Settings . Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. Important Using an offset is usually the better solution: • Point coordinates are measured correctly, and they do not change. This is particularly important when you need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). • Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. • Whenever you move data, you change the coordinates themselves. Use this option only if you want to work with this data only in your office and you do not need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). If a project with large coordinates is at an advanced stage, Allplan provides another solution that helps you enhance the representation of this data. • Open the Options on the Desktop environment page and select the Optimize working with large coordinates option. Allplan optimizes the coordinates of the elements internally, restoring the original values each time you save the data, for example. Adjusting units and lengths During conversion, you can use three parameters to control how the program adjusts the units in the source system to the units in the destination system. Depending on the source system and destination system, you might not be able to change the Unit and Layout scale parameters. By using the Resizing factor , however, you can always adjust the units.",

When printing in batch mode, you can use a fixed print profile for all the layouts or you can use the print profiles saved with the individual layouts. In this case, you can make temporary changes in the print profile of the current layout. Allplan uses the global settings for layouts without print profiles. The print profile you select in the Export PDF Data tool has a higher priority rating than the print profiles saved with the layouts; therefore, this print profile is used for all the PDF files that are created in batch mode. Allplan saves the print profile to the favorite file so that you can also use the print profile in Allplan Exchange Layout Distribution . Printing in batch mode When you have selected several layouts for printing in the Print Layouts tool, these layouts will be printed in batch mode. If a Windows driver is selected for the current layout, you can specify the output device, paper format and print profile you want to use. Thus, you can send some layouts straight to a printer and create print files for the other layouts. If you have selected an Allplan vector driver in the current layout, the program uses this driver to print all the layouts that are part of the batch. Depending on the selected setting, all layouts are sent straight to the printer or several print files are created. Printing several layouts with Windows drivers (batch mode) As opposed to printing in batch mode with Allplan vector drivers, you can specify the output device, paper format and print profile for the selected layouts when you use Windows drivers. If the defined page format is not available as a paper format for the output device, you can use similar formats.\n\nInstallation, Basics Layouts and printing 287 Using r aster drivers If you want to use an Allplan raster driver, you must connect this raster driver with a Windows printer driver. Note : You can do this with devices of the same type only. For example, you can connect an HP DesignJet 800 42 Windows driver with the Allplan HP-RTL DesignJet 500/800 or HP-RasterLib DesignJet 800 42 raster driver. However, it would be useless to connect an Epson Stylus Windows driver with the Allplan HP-RTL DesignJet 500/800 raster driver. To use a raster driver 1 In Layout Editor , click Print Layouts . 2 Select the printer for which you want to use the raster driver in the Settings area on the Printer tab. 3 Select the Allplan raster driver option and choose the raster driver appropriate to the selected printer in the list box.

Often, you want to have the current edit status on paper without having to assemble a layout first. Thus, you can also print details or sections of floor plans. To create the printout, Allplan uses the settings (for example, margins, header, footer, construction lines) defined in Print Preview . You can also define the scale and the section of the printout. In addition, you can set up the printer. If you want to print the contents of the active viewport without defining print settings beforehand, select the Quick Print tool in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File menu. The print job will immediately be sent to the printer specified in print preview. If you want to select the printer, click Print in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File menu. • You create the finished layouts with the tools in the Layout Editor task.

Note, however, that there are some special elements and properties: • Layer : Elements retain their layers. Elements on frozen layers (visible and hidden) will not be copied. • Default planes : You must use Ctrl+A to select default planes. See also \"Behavior of default planes when copying or moving elements between documents\" in the Allplan Help. • Group number : Elements get new group numbers when you place them. Elements that had the same group numbers still have the same group numbers. • Document size : The program displays an error message if the file size is too large after you have inserted elements. • Texts : If the application from which you have copied texts to the clipboard is an OLE server (such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel), the contents of the clipboard will be pasted as an OLE object into Allplan. To paste the contents of the clipboard as normal text, use Paste Contents – Unformatted (Unicode) Text .

The following table shows the sequence in which elements appear on the screen. The Number column shows the priority; the lower the number, the higher the priority of the corresponding setting. For example, elements in drawing files open in reference mode are always behind elements in the current document or in files open in edit mode, regardless of other settings. No. Setting Explanation 1 Document status Elements in the current document or in documents open in edit mode always appear in front of elements in reference drawing files. 2 Show/Hide - Surface elements in background option When this option is selected, surface elements (hatching, pattern, fill) are placed behind other elements. 3 Sequence element property See Sequence property (see \"'Sequence' property\" on page 111) 4 Time of creation/modification Elements that were created or modified later are placed in front of other elements. Note : For more information on the sequence in the layout, see “Sequence in which elements print (on page 290)”\n\n290 Sequence in which elements print Allplan 2020 Sequence in which elements print You need to distinguish between the sequence in which elements within a document print and the sequence in which documents and other elements in a layout print. The settings you make for the printer or the Windows driver also affect the sequence. Printing sequence within a document • Sequence in which elements are created or modified: By default, elements are drawn based on the sequence in which they were created or modified. The element you created or modified most recently is always on top, hiding the other elements with the same sequence value. • Display sequence: You can define the display sequence of elements by entering a value between -15 and +16. The elements appear on the screen in accordance with the value set: The greater the value, the further up the element. In other words, the element with the greatest value is on top of all the other elements. If several elements have the same value, the display sequence depends on the sequence in which the elements were created or modified. You can generally place surface elements in the background. New elements are given fixed default values, which you can define in the Options - Desktop environment page - General area - Sequence defaults button. You can modify these values. To do this, right-click an element and choose Format Properties - Sequence on the shortcut menu. As an alternative, select Modify Format Properties - Sequence in the Change task area. Elements from V2003 with the Always on Top format property get the value +12. • Surface elements (hatching, patterns, fills, bitmap areas, OLE elements, XRefs): You can specify whether surface elements behave like other elements (that is, printing based on creation sequence or display sequence) or whether they are to stay in the background. In the latter case, the creation sequence or display sequence defined controls only the sequence of the surface elements Tip: To bring an element to the top: Move the element and specify the same point for from point and to point . Allplan then ‘re-creates’ the element, placing it on top of the other elements.\n\n292 Sequence in which elements print Allplan 2020 Note : Display on the screen and PDF export consider the display sequence of elements. Documents placed get a value of -13, which cannot be changed. Consequently, documents placed in a layout cover elements with a display sequence of -14 and 15, which are placed directly in the layout. The Surface elements in background and Surface elements in background of each document options do not affect elements placed directly in layouts. Settings at the printer The settings vary depending on the printer you use (for example, HP, Océ). Please refer to the documentation that came with your printer. To optimize the results, you might have to change the settings several times. Example (HP DesignJet 650C): Pen parameters - Overlay Example (HP DesignJet 800): Setup menu - HP-GL/2 setting - Overlay • Off: (default setting): Elements hide one another in accordance with rules 1-3. • On: Elements blend (fills will become mixed colors; lines will be visible in fills). Rules 1-3 do not apply! Example (Océ 9700, Job Director): Data format - Language - specific settings - Controller • Overlay : Elements hide one another in accordance with rules 1-3. • Blend : Elements blend (fills will become mixed colors; lines will be visible in fills). Rules 1-3 do not apply! Settings you can make for the Windows driver Most Windows drivers (for example, for HP DesignJet 650C) automatically deactivate certain printer settings (for example, the Overlay function). In most cases, you cannot use the driver to control these functions. Use output channels instead.",

The element that was created or modified most recently appears on top, hiding other elements that have the same sequence value.\n\nYou can override this default behavior by manually defining a display sequence value between -15 and +16.

        "context": "290 Sequence in which elements print Allplan 2020 Sequence in which elements print You need to distinguish between the sequence in which elements within a document print and the sequence in which documents and other elements in a layout print. The settings you make for the printer or the Windows driver also affect the sequence. Printing sequence within a document • Sequence in which elements are created or modified: By default, elements are drawn based on the sequence in which they were created or modified. The element you created or modified most recently is always on top, hiding the other elements with the same sequence value. • Display sequence: You can define the display sequence of elements by entering a value between -15 and +16. The elements appear on the screen in accordance with the value set: The greater the value, the further up the element. In other words, the element with the greatest value is on top of all the other elements. If several elements have the same value, the display sequence depends on the sequence in which the elements were created or modified. You can generally place surface elements in the background. New elements are given fixed default values, which you can define in the Options - Desktop environment page - General area - Sequence defaults button. You can modify these values. To do this, right-click an element and choose Format Properties - Sequence on the shortcut menu. As an alternative, select Modify Format Properties - Sequence in the Change task area. Elements from V2003 with the Always on Top format property get the value +12. • Surface elements (hatching, patterns, fills, bitmap areas, OLE elements, XRefs): You can specify whether surface elements behave like other elements (that is, printing based on creation sequence or display sequence) or whether they are to stay in the background. In the latter case, the creation sequence or display sequence defined controls only the sequence of the surface elements Tip: To bring an element to the top: Move the element and specify the same point for from point and to point . Allplan then ‘re-creates’ the element, placing it on top of the other elements.\n\n292 Sequence in which elements print Allplan 2020 Note : Display on the screen and PDF export consider the display sequence of elements. Documents placed get a value of -13, which cannot be changed. Consequently, documents placed in a layout cover elements with a display sequence of -14 and 15, which are placed directly in the layout. The Surface elements in background and Surface elements in background of each document options do not affect elements placed directly in layouts. Settings at the printer The settings vary depending on the printer you use (for example, HP, Océ). Please refer to the documentation that came with your printer. To optimize the results, you might have to change the settings several times. Example (HP DesignJet 650C): Pen parameters - Overlay Example (HP DesignJet 800): Setup menu - HP-GL/2 setting - Overlay • Off: (default setting): Elements hide one another in accordance with rules 1-3. • On: Elements blend (fills will become mixed colors; lines will be visible in fills). Rules 1-3 do not apply! Example (Océ 9700, Job Director): Data format - Language - specific settings - Controller • Overlay : Elements hide one another in accordance with rules 1-3. • Blend : Elements blend (fills will become mixed colors; lines will be visible in fills). Rules 1-3 do not apply! Settings you can make for the Windows driver Most Windows drivers (for example, for HP DesignJet 650C) automatically deactivate certain printer settings (for example, the Overlay function). In most cases, you cannot use the driver to control these functions. Use output channels instead.\n\nInstallation, Basics Layouts and printing 275 Layouts and printing Output options Allplan 2020 provides two options for printing data: • You can use Print and Quick Print to print results at any time. Often, you want to have the current edit status on paper without having to assemble a layout first. Thus, you can also print details or sections of floor plans. To create the printout, Allplan uses the settings (for example, margins, header, footer, construction lines) defined in Print Preview . You can also define the scale and the section of the printout. In addition, you can set up the printer. If you want to print the contents of the active viewport without defining print settings beforehand, select the Quick Print tool in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File menu. The print job will immediately be sent to the printer specified in print preview. If you want to select the printer, click Print in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File menu. • You create the finished layouts with the tools in the Layout Editor task. You define the sheet size and scope of the layout and place the layout border and title block. You can use print sets to control what is printed. When printing layouts, you can select the elements to be printed and the output device.",

Then, move the data toward the origin by using the Move tool in Allplan. • Define offset coordinates in the Project Settings . Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. Important Using an offset is usually the better solution: • Point coordinates are measured correctly, and they do not change. This is particularly important when you need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). • Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. • Whenever you move data, you change the coordinates themselves. Use this option only if you want to work with this data only in your office and you do not need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). If a project with large coordinates is at an advanced stage, Allplan provides another solution that helps you enhance the representation of this data. • Open the Options on the Desktop environment page and select the Optimize working with large coordinates option. Allplan optimizes the coordinates of the elements internally, restoring the original values each time you save the data, for example. Adjusting units and lengths During conversion, you can use three parameters to control how the program adjusts the units in the source system to the units in the destination system. Depending on the source system and destination system, you might not be able to change the Unit and Layout scale parameters. By using the Resizing factor , however, you can always adjust the units.",

Select smart symbols in the Library palette and place the smart symbols in the workspace. Using SmartParts What are SmartParts? A SmartPart is a parametric Allplan CAD object that acts according to its own logic, which is independent of the CAD system. By using simple, parametric descriptions, you can turn complex geometries of basic elements into new, independent and intelligent objects. These objects are worked out in great detail, including all Allplan resources that are available by default (line, pen, color, layer, and so on). To model SmartParts, you can use all general options.

Allplan uses the definition and assignment of the individual foils to reassemble the smart symbol at different scales and display modes. The exact position of the foils is preserved, even when you resize a smart symbol. This is made possible by a reference point and so-called resizing points. When you design a smart symbol, you can define areas of the design entity as being dynamic (resizable) or static. A good example is a window frame whose sections remain constant - as opposed to the glass surface whose height and width must be variable. (A) 3D view (B) 2D view for a scale range of 1:1 to 1:99; this view consists of two foils, because the profiles remain constant while the glass surface needs to be variable.

When you use the selection rectangle, you can specify whether you want to select elements fully bounded by the region, fully bounded and intersected or intersected elements only. The Selection area of the Actionbar and the Filter Assistant toolbar provide the following options: • Selects the elements that are fully bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selects the elements that are fully or partially bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selects the elements that are partially bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selection depends on the direction in which you enter the selection rectangle: - Entering the region in the positive x-direction selects elements that are fully bounded by the region only. - Entering the region in the negative x-direction selects all the elements that are fully or partially bounded by the region. With this method, the selection rectangle is shown as dashed lines. Note: Select elements based on direction is the default. The selection rectangle is a colored area, which is indicated by the icons. The color of the area changes with the selection option you activate. The easiest way to enter the region is to select and hold the left mouse button and to enter two points that define diagonally opposite corners of a selection rectangle.

This is because an embedded object is a copy of the source document that is placed within the Allplan document and is no longer linked to the original.

        "context": "208 Linking and embedding OLE objects Allplan 2020 Linking and embedding OLE objects You can insert OLE objects in Allplan in two ways. The difference lies in the way Allplan saves the objects: Linking objects When objects are linked with Allplan, the Allplan document is linked with the object in question. When the object changes, you can manually update the link in Allplan. Double-clicking the linked object in Allplan opens it in its original application and you can edit it as usual. You must not change the paths to the source document and to the original application. When you rename either one, you must create the link again. Embedding objects When objects are embedded in Allplan, a copy of the source document is placed in the Allplan document. After you have inserted this copy, it is no longer linked to the source document. In other words, the program cannot update the Allplan document to reflect any changes you make to the source document. Embedded objects can be edited either in Allplan or in their original application; but any changes you make to the object have no effect on the source document.\n\nInstallation, Basics Using OLE objects 209 Transparency of OLE objects The background of OLE objects can only be transparent or not transparent; the default setting is transparent. Transparent background means that you can see the Allplan background color instead of the background color of the OLE object. Therefore, turn off transparency when you use a black background in Allplan and the OLE object you have embedded is a Word document with black text, for example. Editing OLE objects Double-clicking an OLE object opens it in its original application and you can edit it as usual. You can also open and edit objects linked with Allplan directly in the original application and then update them in Allplan. All you have to do is double-click these objects and edit them. Just double-click these objects and edit them. Embedded objects can be edited either in Allplan or in their original application; but any changes you make to the object have no effect on the source document. You can use Allplan tools such as Copy, Move, and so on to edit OLE objects. To change the size of OLE objects, use the Resize tool.\n\nInstallation, Basics Using OLE objects 207 Using OLE objects Using OLE objects By means of the OLE technology, you can link and embed objects and thus exchange information between different applications. Data from a source document (for example, Microsoft® Word) is associated with or embedded in an Allplan document. When you select the embedded data, the original application opens, and you can edit the data in the source document. The following object types can be embedded in Allplan (depending on the applications you have installed): • Excel files (.xls, xlsx) • Word files (.doc, .docx) • RTF files (.rtf) • PowerPoint files (.ppt, pptx) • Bitmaps (for example, .bmp, .jpg) The linked program must be an OLE server program (such as many Microsoft Office programs).

        "context": "Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 275 Layouts and printing Output options Allplan 2020 provides two options for printing data: • You can use Print and Quick Print to print results at any time. Often, you want to have the current edit status on paper without having to assemble a layout first. Thus, you can also print details or sections of floor plans. To create the printout, Allplan uses the settings (for example, margins, header, footer, construction lines) defined in Print Preview . You can also define the scale and the section of the printout. In addition, you can set up the printer. If you want to print the contents of the active viewport without defining print settings beforehand, select the Quick Print tool in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File menu. The print job will immediately be sent to the printer specified in print preview. If you want to select the printer, click Print in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File menu. • You create the finished layouts with the tools in the Layout Editor task. You define the sheet size and scope of the layout and place the layout border and title block. You can use print sets to control what is printed. When printing layouts, you can select the elements to be printed and the output device.\n\n298 Printing in batch mode Allplan 2020 single printout. The next time you load the layout, the settings saved to the print profile will be used again. When printing in batch mode, you can use a fixed print profile for all the layouts or you can use the print profiles saved with the individual layouts. In this case, you can make temporary changes in the print profile of the current layout. Allplan uses the global settings for layouts without print profiles. The print profile you select in the Export PDF Data tool has a higher priority rating than the print profiles saved with the layouts; therefore, this print profile is used for all the PDF files that are created in batch mode. Allplan saves the print profile to the favorite file so that you can also use the print profile in Allplan Exchange Layout Distribution . Printing in batch mode When you have selected several layouts for printing in the Print Layouts tool, these layouts will be printed in batch mode. If a Windows driver is selected for the current layout, you can specify the output device, paper format and print profile you want to use. Thus, you can send some layouts straight to a printer and create print files for the other layouts. If you have selected an Allplan vector driver in the current layout, the program uses this driver to print all the layouts that are part of the batch. Depending on the selected setting, all layouts are sent straight to the printer or several print files are created. Printing several layouts with Windows drivers (batch mode) As opposed to printing in batch mode with Allplan vector drivers, you can specify the output device, paper format and print profile for the selected layouts when you use Windows drivers. If the defined page format is not available as a paper format for the output device, you can use similar formats.\n\n290 Sequence in which elements print Allplan 2020 Sequence in which elements print You need to distinguish between the sequence in which elements within a document print and the sequence in which documents and other elements in a layout print. The settings you make for the printer or the Windows driver also affect the sequence. Printing sequence within a document • Sequence in which elements are created or modified: By default, elements are drawn based on the sequence in which they were created or modified. The element you created or modified most recently is always on top, hiding the other elements with the same sequence value. • Display sequence: You can define the display sequence of elements by entering a value between -15 and +16. The elements appear on the screen in accordance with the value set: The greater the value, the further up the element. In other words, the element with the greatest value is on top of all the other elements. If several elements have the same value, the display sequence depends on the sequence in which the elements were created or modified. You can generally place surface elements in the background. New elements are given fixed default values, which you can define in the Options - Desktop environment page - General area - Sequence defaults button. You can modify these values. To do this, right-click an element and choose Format Properties - Sequence on the shortcut menu. As an alternative, select Modify Format Properties - Sequence in the Change task area. Elements from V2003 with the Always on Top format property get the value +12. • Surface elements (hatching, patterns, fills, bitmap areas, OLE elements, XRefs): You can specify whether surface elements behave like other elements (that is, printing based on creation sequence or display sequence) or whether they are to stay in the background. In the latter case, the creation sequence or display sequence defined controls only the sequence of the surface elements Tip: To bring an element to the top: Move the element and specify the same point for from point and to point . Allplan then ‘re-creates’ the element, placing it on top of the other elements.",

You can make this setting on the right side of the dialog line. You can restrict movement to horizontal and vertical (enter at right angles) or enter a cursor snap angle of your choice. The program considers the current setting for the system angle. If, for example, the system angle is 30°, then this is interpreted as being horizontal. Note : A cursor snap angle has priority over any point snap settings, as well as any other settings on the shortcut menu. This means that only points in alignment with one of the cursor snap angles will be snapped. You can use the following options in the dialog line to restrict cursor movement to a specific direction or angle: Icon Tool Use No icon pressed in The line can be drawn at any angle. This is the default setting. Enter at right angles The line can be drawn only at right angles to the current system angle.

Then, move the data toward the origin by using the Move tool in Allplan. • Define offset coordinates in the Project Settings . Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. Important Using an offset is usually the better solution: • Point coordinates are measured correctly, and they do not change. This is particularly important when you need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). • Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. • Whenever you move data, you change the coordinates themselves. Use this option only if you want to work with this data only in your office and you do not need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). If a project with large coordinates is at an advanced stage, Allplan provides another solution that helps you enhance the representation of this data. • Open the Options on the Desktop environment page and select the Optimize working with large coordinates option. Allplan optimizes the coordinates of the elements internally, restoring the original values each time you save the data, for example. Adjusting units and lengths During conversion, you can use three parameters to control how the program adjusts the units in the source system to the units in the destination system.

You can find the wizards in a group as tabs in the Wizards palette. You can select a wizard group by clicking in the list box at the top of the Wizards palette. Wizard groups are saved to a *.nagd file. You can use Add group. on the shortcut menu to select an existing *.nagd file and add this file to the palette (when you want to use a wizard group of a colleague, for example). A wizard group file is a text file, containing references to the wizard files (*.nas). The path saved is a relative path. You can use the shortcut menu of a tab to add, remove, replace and rename tabs. You can use drag-and-drop editing to change the arrangement of the tabs. The ToolTip of a tab shows the path and file name of the associated wizard file. Note : The wizards that come with Allplan are in the \\etc\\Assistent folder. You can find them in the Allplan group. You cannot change the wizards in this group. If you want to define your own wizards, you must create a new wizard group first. When you open a country-specific project, Allplan displays the country- specific wizards, adding the country code to the group name (for example, Allplan .eng )",

This example shows the Properties dialog box for a slab opening. Note: The current layer is also saved. When you retrieve favorite files later, this layer automatically becomes the current layer.

To specify a selection rectangle: Use the left mouse button to open a selection rectangle. In the Optio ns - Desktop environment - Selection page - Selection area, you can specify that closing the selection rectangle requires a second click. When working with the selection rectangle, you can specify whether you want to select elements fully bounded by the region, fully bounded and intersected or intersected elements only. To specify a fence : Click Fence and enter the points defining the outline of the fence. Select all elements. In the case of some tools (for example, Export ), you can select all the elements in the current document by clicking All in the input options.

When you use the selection rectangle, you can specify whether you want to select elements fully bounded by the region, fully bounded and intersected or intersected elements only. The Selection area of the Actionbar and the Filter Assistant toolbar provide the following options: • Selects the elements that are fully bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selects the elements that are fully or partially bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selects the elements that are partially bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selection depends on the direction in which you enter the selection rectangle: - Entering the region in the positive x-direction selects elements that are fully bounded by the region only. - Entering the region in the negative x-direction selects all the elements that are fully or partially bounded by the region. With this method, the selection rectangle is shown as dashed lines. Note: Select elements based on direction is the default. The selection rectangle is a colored area, which is indicated by the icons. The color of the area changes with the selection option you activate. The easiest way to enter the region is to select and hold the left mouse button and to enter two points that define diagonally opposite corners of a selection rectangle.

        "context": "208 Linking and embedding OLE objects Allplan 2020 Linking and embedding OLE objects You can insert OLE objects in Allplan in two ways. The difference lies in the way Allplan saves the objects: Linking objects When objects are linked with Allplan, the Allplan document is linked with the object in question. When the object changes, you can manually update the link in Allplan. Double-clicking the linked object in Allplan opens it in its original application and you can edit it as usual. You must not change the paths to the source document and to the original application. When you rename either one, you must create the link again. Embedding objects When objects are embedded in Allplan, a copy of the source document is placed in the Allplan document. After you have inserted this copy, it is no longer linked to the source document. In other words, the program cannot update the Allplan document to reflect any changes you make to the source document. Embedded objects can be edited either in Allplan or in their original application; but any changes you make to the object have no effect on the source document.\n\nInstallation, Basics Using OLE objects 207 Using OLE objects Using OLE objects By means of the OLE technology, you can link and embed objects and thus exchange information between different applications. Data from a source document (for example, Microsoft® Word) is associated with or embedded in an Allplan document. When you select the embedded data, the original application opens, and you can edit the data in the source document. The following object types can be embedded in Allplan (depending on the applications you have installed): • Excel files (.xls, xlsx) • Word files (.doc, .docx) • RTF files (.rtf) • PowerPoint files (.ppt, pptx) • Bitmaps (for example, .bmp, .jpg) The linked program must be an OLE server program (such as many Microsoft Office programs). Otherwise, the linked program cannot provide OLE objects.\n\nInstallation, Basics Using OLE objects 209 Transparency of OLE objects The background of OLE objects can only be transparent or not transparent; the default setting is transparent. Transparent background means that you can see the Allplan background color instead of the background color of the OLE object. Therefore, turn off transparency when you use a black background in Allplan and the OLE object you have embedded is a Word document with black text, for example. Editing OLE objects Double-clicking an OLE object opens it in its original application and you can edit it as usual. You can also open and edit objects linked with Allplan directly in the original application and then update them in Allplan. All you have to do is double-click these objects and edit them. Just double-click these objects and edit them. Embedded objects can be edited either in Allplan or in their original application; but any changes you make to the object have no effect on the source document. You can use Allplan tools such as Copy, Move, and so on to edit OLE objects. To change the size of OLE objects, use the Resize tool.",

In addition, you can apply bitmaps to areas or use architectural area styles for 2D areas (we will use the term \"surface element\" to refer to the wide range of options provided by Allplan). The library of hatching styles that comes with Allplan provides a wide range of hatching styles and patterns. However, you can also define your own hatching styles and patterns (click Defaults on the Tools menu) or modify those that come with the program. You can display the boundary of hatching, patterns and fills as a construction line by selecting the appropriate option in Show/Hide . You are advised to use the polyline entry tools to enter areas to which you want to apply a surface element, such as hatching, pattern, fill.\n\nInstallation, Basics Applying surface elements 181 Hatching and scale Whenever you apply hatching, you can specify whether the spacing between the hatching lines is to remain constant or change dynamically with the reference scale. This means that you can distinguish between hatching used to display real objects, and symbolic hatching, e.g., concrete hatching. Tiles should appear larger or smaller depending on the selected reference scale. Symbolic hatching, on the other hand, should have the same spacing between lines regardless of scale. You can make this setting in two places • In the hatching properties when you create an area with hatching: Here, you can specify whether the hatching is to adapt to the scale or remain constant, regardless of the scale. • In hatching defaults: You can set the spacing between hatching lines (for the Adjust to scale in layout setting) and the scale to which the line spacing is to apply. This setting also defines how component hatching behaves.

Then, move the data toward the origin by using the Move tool in Allplan. • Define offset coordinates in the Project Settings . Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. Important Using an offset is usually the better solution: • Point coordinates are measured correctly, and they do not change. This is particularly important when you need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). • Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. • Whenever you move data, you change the coordinates themselves. Use this option only if you want to work with this data only in your office and you do not need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). If a project with large coordinates is at an advanced stage, Allplan provides another solution that helps you enhance the representation of this data. • Open the Options on the Desktop environment page and select the Optimize working with large coordinates option. Allplan optimizes the coordinates of the elements internally, restoring the original values each time you save the data, for example. Adjusting units and lengths During conversion, you can use three parameters to control how the program adjusts the units in the source system to the units in the destination system. Depending on the source system and destination system, you might not be able to change the Unit and Layout scale parameters.

When you check the log file after having imported a file with large coordinates, you will find the following warning: Coordinates exceed 5,000 m. Large coordinates can cause problems when you edit the imported data in Allplan. Do the following to use the data without problem: • During import you can use Adjust center of gravity to: ( Settings - General Settings tab) to tell Allplan how to handle data with large coordinates: - When you select the Off option, the data remain unchanged. - Select the Adjust center of gravity to: Offset option. This automatically enters an offset in the Project Settings , moving the origin of the file (= center of the min-max box) to the origin of the coordinate system. You cannot use this option when you have already specified an offset in the Project Settings . Note : Here, offset means that Allplan moves the data during import; the values by which the data is moved will automatically be written to the project. This offset applies to the entire project. An offset changes the coordinates of the drawing files in this project. - Select the Adjust center of gravity to: Origin option. This moves the center of the data to the origin of the Allplan coordinate system. • During import, you can define an additional offset in the Settings . Allplan will use this offset in addition to the offset defined in the Project Settings .

        "context": "Installation, Basics Exchanging data with other programs 259 You can define these parameters in the Settings dialog box in the Coordinates and length parameters area. Unit Depending on whether your partner office is using m, cm or mm, they will enter 1.0, 100.0 or 1000.0 when drawing a one-meter line. With the Unit parameter, you indicate to the program whether the value is to be interpreted as mm, cm, dm and so on. During import : Select the unit with which the file being converted (the source file) was created. During export : Select the unit with which the exported file (the destination file) is to be further edited. Contact your partner office to find out which unit they use in their files. The reason for this is that in the case of coordinate entries and length entries, only the figure (and not the unit) is present in the source file. In DWG/DXF files, the elements can be stored in any unit. Note : In some systems, the unit in which lengths and coordinates are saved is predefined and cannot be changed. In Allplan, lengths and coordinates are always saved in mm, regardless of which unit was used when the data was entered. To account for different units, use the Resizing factor parameter. Note : The unit that the destination system uses is always predefined; it varies depending on the destination system. For conversions to Allplan, for example, data is always saved in mm; for conversions to AutoCAD, the unit is always m.\n\n258 DWG, DXF, DGN interfaces Allplan 2020 • Import the data. Then, move the data toward the origin by using the Move tool in Allplan. • Define offset coordinates in the Project Settings . Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. Important Using an offset is usually the better solution: • Point coordinates are measured correctly, and they do not change. This is particularly important when you need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). • Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. • Whenever you move data, you change the coordinates themselves. Use this option only if you want to work with this data only in your office and you do not need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). If a project with large coordinates is at an advanced stage, Allplan provides another solution that helps you enhance the representation of this data. • Open the Options on the Desktop environment page and select the Optimize working with large coordinates option. Allplan optimizes the coordinates of the elements internally, restoring the original values each time you save the data, for example. Adjusting units and lengths During conversion, you can use three parameters to control how the program adjusts the units in the source system to the units in the destination system. Depending on the source system and destination system, you might not be able to change the Unit and Layout scale parameters. By using the Resizing factor , however, you can always adjust the units.\n\nInstallation, Basics Exchanging data with other programs 257 Importing files with large coordinates DXF and DWG files can contain elements with very large coordinates; this is especially true in the case of files with country coordinates. When you check the log file after having imported a file with large coordinates, you will find the following warning: Coordinates exceed 5,000 m. Large coordinates can cause problems when you edit the imported data in Allplan. Do the following to use the data without problem: • During import you can use Adjust center of gravity to: ( Settings - General Settings tab) to tell Allplan how to handle data with large coordinates: - When you select the Off option, the data remain unchanged. - Select the Adjust center of gravity to: Offset option. This automatically enters an offset in the Project Settings , moving the origin of the file (= center of the min-max box) to the origin of the coordinate system. You cannot use this option when you have already specified an offset in the Project Settings . Note : Here, offset means that Allplan moves the data during import; the values by which the data is moved will automatically be written to the project. This offset applies to the entire project. An offset changes the coordinates of the drawing files in this project. - Select the Adjust center of gravity to: Origin option. This moves the center of the data to the origin of the Allplan coordinate system. • During import, you can define an additional offset in the Settings . Allplan will use this offset in addition to the offset defined in the Project Settings . Pay attention to the direction of conversion when you enter an offset: - Negative values for import - Positive values for export",

Allplan uses the definition and assignment of the individual foils to reassemble the smart symbol at different scales and display modes. The exact position of the foils is preserved, even when you resize a smart symbol. This is made possible by a reference point and so-called resizing points.

A SmartPart is a parametric Allplan CAD object that acts according to its own logic, which is independent of the CAD system. By using simple, parametric descriptions, you can turn complex geometries of basic elements into new, independent and intelligent objects. These objects are worked out in great detail, including all Allplan resources that are available by default (line, pen, color, layer, and so on). To model SmartParts, you can use all general options. For example, you can join SmartParts, slice them or subtract them from each other. However, you need to define these options in the relevant objects beforehand. Depending on the scripting method used, the objects contain 2D and 3D information.\n\nvi Contents Allplan 2020 Pattern and scale . 185 “Constant in layout” pattern setting . 185 “Adjust to scale in layout” pattern setting . 187 Applying patterns to architectural components .188 Working efficiently thanks to libraries and defaults . . . 189 Saving default settings in dialog boxes . 189 Saving and loading parameters as favorites . 190 Using symbols . 191 Inserting profiles from Bimplus in the Allplan library . 192 Using smart symbols . 193 What are smart symbols? . 193 Smart symbol properties . 194 Components of a smart symbol . 195 General approach for defining smart symbols . 196 Using SmartParts . 197 What are SmartParts? . 197 Using SmartParts . 198 Selecting and placing SmartParts . 199 Creating your own SmartParts .200 SmartPart technology for modeling objects . 201 Using PythonParts . 202 What are PythonParts? . 202 Placing a PythonPart . 202 Allplan Visual Scripting . 203 Paths . 204 Using and importing content . 205",

        "answer": "# Drawing Files in Allplan\n\nDrawing files serve as the primary working documents in Allplan for design and data creation. Here's how they function:\n\n## Primary Uses\n\n**Active Work Environment**: Drawing files act as the workspace where you create and modify design elements. At any given time, one drawing file must be designated as the current or active file—this is where your actual drawing work takes place.\n\n**Multi-file Workflow**: You can have up to 128 drawing files open simultaneously in different states:\n- **Edit mode**: Elements are visible and can be modified\n- **Reference mode**: Elements are visible but cannot be modified\n- **Not selected**: Elements remain hidden\n\n## Data Organization\n\nDrawing files are structured by project and serve as containers for model data, views, and sections. They can be linked together, allowing Allplan to reference and consider model data across multiple files. This is particularly useful when creating views and sections that derive from building structures or when using automatic updates.\n\n## IT Equivalent\n\nWhile the context doesn't explicitly state an IT equivalent, drawing files function similarly to **layers or workspaces in collaborative design software**—they're individual document files that can be organized hierarchically within a project structure, opened in different access modes (read/write or read-only), and linked together to create dependencies and references across the design system.",

At any given time, one drawing file must be designated as the current or active file—this is where your actual drawing work takes place.\n\n**Multi-file Workflow**: You can have up to 128 drawing files open simultaneously in different states:\n- **Edit mode**: Elements are visible and can be modified\n- **Reference mode**: Elements are visible but cannot be modified\n- **Not selected**: Elements remain hidden\n\n## Data Organization\n\nDrawing files are structured by project and serve as containers for model data, views, and sections. They can be linked together, allowing Allplan to reference and consider model data across multiple files. This is particularly useful when creating views and sections that derive from building structures or when using automatic updates.\n\n## IT Equivalent\n\nWhile the context doesn't explicitly state an IT equivalent, drawing files function similarly to **layers or workspaces in collaborative design software**—they're individual document files that can be organized hierarchically within a project structure, opened in different access modes (read/write or read-only), and linked together to create dependencies and references across the design system.",
        "context": "222 Working with drawing files Allplan 2020 7 Open in reference mode The drawing file has been opened by another user in the workgroup environment. 8 Open in reference mode The drawing file has been opened by another user in the workgroup environment; the color red indicates that the drawing file has changed. You can apply the changes by selecting Update drawing file on the shortcut menu. In the Options - Desktop environment page, you can configure the program to inform you of changes in reference drawing files. 9 Linked drawing file The drawing file contains model data or views and sections linked with other drawing files. Allplan links drawing files when you create views and sections with the tools in the Reinforcement Views task area. You can use the shortcut menu to list all reference drawing files of the current drawing file or open its reference drawing files in edit or reference mode. 10 Views and sections created automatically The drawing file contains views and sections that you created by using the shortcut menu in the “Derived from building structure” area or views and sections that you created with the tools in the Sections task area of which the results were saved in this drawing file. These views and sections usually refer to other drawing files. Allplan considers the model data in these drawing files. 11 Update locked By using the shortcut menu in the \"Derived from building structure\" area, you can lock the update of drawing files with views and sections created with the Update automatically option not being selected. Allplan cannot update the result until the drawing file is unlocked or the Update automatically option is selected. After having confirmed a prompt, you can create a new view or section in the drawing file. 12 Views and sections placed manually The drawing file contains views and sections created with the tools in the Sections task area. These views and sections can refer to other drawing files. Allplan considers the model data in these drawing files.\n\n216 Structuring and managing data Allplan 2020 Working with projects and documents - comparison The table below compares the tools for handling files provided by the two variants. When working with projects, you use drawing files and NDW files. When working with documents, you use NDW files and NPL files. Note : Always use a separate document (drawing file or NDW file) for each story, regardless of whether you work with projects or documents. Tool Projects Documents Create new document, drawing file Open on a Project -Specific Basis New Open existing document, drawing file Open on a Project -Specific Basis Open Copy entire document, drawing file Copy, Move Elements between Documents Save as Use data as a reference Open on a Project -Specific Basis - open a drawing file in reference mode Or XRef NDW XRef You work with projects You use drawing files which are structured by project. You can use drawing files open in reference or edit mode or XRef files as backdrops. You work with documents You use NDW files. You can use NDW-XRef files as backdrops.\n\nInstallation, Basics Structuring and managing data 221 Drawing file status With the drawing file status, you define the drawing file on which you draw and which drawing files are visible and can be modified. The following illustration shows the different drawing file statuses. You can find an explanation in the table. Number Drawing file status Comment 1 Current or active The current or active drawing file is the one in which you draw. There must always be one current or active drawing file. 2 Open in edit mode Elements in drawing files open in edit mode are visible and can be modified. Up to 128 drawing files can be open simultaneously (regardless of whether they are current, in edit mode or in reference mode). 3 Open in reference mode Elements in drawing files open in reference mode are visible, but they cannot be modified. You can configure the program to use the same color for all elements in reference drawing files. To do this, select the Options , click Desktop environment and open the Display page. You cannot open empty drawing files in reference mode. 4 Not selected Elements in these drawing files are not visible. 5 Empty Empty drawing files have no data type icon. 6 Assigned temporarily The drawing file is assigned temporarily to the fileset. Allplan clears this assignment as soon as you switch to a different fileset.",

Go to the Selection area, click the button beside Elements to print and select the Surface elements in background of each document option. - To print with Print : Open the Show/Hide tool and select the Surface elements in background option. • Scanned images: - To print straight from layout editor: Scanned images always print in the background (within a drawing file). - To print with Print : Scanned images print in the foreground or background depending on the setting in Show/Hide . Printing sequence with several documents • Documents are printed in the sequence in which they have been added to the layout. In other words, those placed first are printed first and are hidden (covered) by the documents added later. To place documents with fills and scans in the background, you must place them in the layout first. • When placing drawing files as a fileset: The drawing files print based on their numbers; that is, drawing files with a higher number hide those with a lower number. • You can use the List Layout Elements tool to change the document sequence later. Documents that appear at the top of the dialog box hide those below. Printing sequence with documents and other elements in the layout First, the program prints the contents of the documents and then the elements you placed directly in the layout (title blocks, symbols, fills). In other words, these elements placed directly in the layout hide the contents of the documents. To avoid this, you need to save these elements in a separate document.\n\nInstallation, Basics Layouts and printing 275 Layouts and printing Output options Allplan 2020 provides two options for printing data: • You can use Print and Quick Print to print results at any time. Often, you want to have the current edit status on paper without having to assemble a layout first. Thus, you can also print details or sections of floor plans. To create the printout, Allplan uses the settings (for example, margins, header, footer, construction lines) defined in Print Preview . You can also define the scale and the section of the printout. In addition, you can set up the printer. If you want to print the contents of the active viewport without defining print settings beforehand, select the Quick Print tool in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File menu. The print job will immediately be sent to the printer specified in print preview. If you want to select the printer, click Print in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File menu. • You create the finished layouts with the tools in the Layout Editor task. You define the sheet size and scope of the layout and place the layout border and title block. You can use print sets to control what is printed. When printing layouts, you can select the elements to be printed and the output device.\n\n290 Sequence in which elements print Allplan 2020 Sequence in which elements print You need to distinguish between the sequence in which elements within a document print and the sequence in which documents and other elements in a layout print. The settings you make for the printer or the Windows driver also affect the sequence. Printing sequence within a document • Sequence in which elements are created or modified: By default, elements are drawn based on the sequence in which they were created or modified. The element you created or modified most recently is always on top, hiding the other elements with the same sequence value. • Display sequence: You can define the display sequence of elements by entering a value between -15 and +16. The elements appear on the screen in accordance with the value set: The greater the value, the further up the element. In other words, the element with the greatest value is on top of all the other elements. If several elements have the same value, the display sequence depends on the sequence in which the elements were created or modified. You can generally place surface elements in the background. New elements are given fixed default values, which you can define in the Options - Desktop environment page - General area - Sequence defaults button. You can modify these values. To do this, right-click an element and choose Format Properties - Sequence on the shortcut menu. As an alternative, select Modify Format Properties - Sequence in the Change task area. Elements from V2003 with the Always on Top format property get the value +12. • Surface elements (hatching, patterns, fills, bitmap areas, OLE elements, XRefs): You can specify whether surface elements behave like other elements (that is, printing based on creation sequence or display sequence) or whether they are to stay in the background. In the latter case, the creation sequence or display sequence defined controls only the sequence of the surface elements Tip: To bring an element to the top: Move the element and specify the same point for from point and to point . Allplan then ‘re-creates’ the element, placing it on top of the other elements.",

        "context": "Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 235 What is the plane model? You manage default planes, roofscapes, offset planes and reference surfaces in a plane model. A plane model contains pairs of default planes. Each pair of planes has a name. The same is true for the lower and upper default planes. The pairs of reference planes in a plane model are equivalent to the stories of a building. You can assign them to the structural levels of the building structure or to individual drawing files. A project can contain several discrete plane models. You can change the height settings of the default planes in the plane model. Any changes made to the height settings are immediately reflected in the drawing files to which you have assigned a default plane from the building model. A plane model must not contain pairs of planes with overlapping height settings with the exception of the pair of planes that defines the minimum and maximum height of the building. You can assign the height settings of a pair of planes to a drawing file or structural level of the building structure. However, you can also use the lower and upper default planes from different pairs of planes. Thus, you can create components across several floors (for example, chimneys). You can also assign default planes that are not associated with the plane model to drawing files. You can even select a custom height for the lower default plane and adopt the upper default plane from a plane model. You can also use plane models without a building structure. In the Options , Plane s page, you can configure the program to display planes in elevation and isometric views.

Then, move the data toward the origin by using the Move tool in Allplan. • Define offset coordinates in the Project Settings . Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. Important Using an offset is usually the better solution: • Point coordinates are measured correctly, and they do not change. This is particularly important when you need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). • Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. • Whenever you move data, you change the coordinates themselves. Use this option only if you want to work with this data only in your office and you do not need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). If a project with large coordinates is at an advanced stage, Allplan provides another solution that helps you enhance the representation of this data. • Open the Options on the Desktop environment page and select the Optimize working with large coordinates option. Allplan optimizes the coordinates of the elements internally, restoring the original values each time you save the data, for example. Adjusting units and lengths During conversion, you can use three parameters to control how the program adjusts the units in the source system to the units in the destination system. Depending on the source system and destination system, you might not be able to change the Unit and Layout scale parameters. By using the Resizing factor , however, you can always adjust the units.",

        "context": "268 IFC interface Allplan 2020 IFC object type You can use the IFC object type (IfcObjectType) attribute to change the IFC classification of components. This is particularly important if you cannot find an appropriate Allplan tool to create a component and thus model the component as a 3D object or a user-defined architectural component. Note: Only use the IFC object type attribute if you need it. IFC object type exports the element as a BREP (surface model). Normally, Allplan elements will be assigned automatically to the appropriate IFC classes (walls, columns, .). If the IFC object type assigned matches the native Allplan element type, the program ignores the assignment, trying to transfer the element not as a BRep. This prevents loss of quality during IFC export. Note: IFC export transfers openings in the following components: wall (IfcWall), downstand beam and upstand beam (IfcBeam), column (IfcColumn), slab (IfcSlab), roof (IfcRoof), foundation (IfcFooting), and BuildingElementProxy. If a different IFC object type is assigned to the component (for example, IfcPlate instead of IfcSlab), openings will not be transferred. Use the Modify Attributes tool to assign the IFC object type (IfcObjectType) attribute to this component and select the appropriate IFC classification afterward. The most commonly used 21 IFC elements are predefined and can be selected directly in the drop-down list. If you cannot find the required element, click any entry and enter the name of the missing element at the keyboard. The program saves the new entry, presenting it again the next time you select attributes. You can find detailed information on all IFC object types and IFC object subtypes in the appendix of the Allplan BIM compendium, which you can download as a PDF file from the Allplan home page (http://www.allplan.com/en).

Then, move the data toward the origin by using the Move tool in Allplan. • Define offset coordinates in the Project Settings . Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. Important Using an offset is usually the better solution: • Point coordinates are measured correctly, and they do not change. This is particularly important when you need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). • Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. • Whenever you move data, you change the coordinates themselves. Use this option only if you want to work with this data only in your office and you do not need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). If a project with large coordinates is at an advanced stage, Allplan provides another solution that helps you enhance the representation of this data. • Open the Options on the Desktop environment page and select the Optimize working with large coordinates option. Allplan optimizes the coordinates of the elements internally, restoring the original values each time you save the data, for example. Adjusting units and lengths During conversion, you can use three parameters to control how the program adjusts the units in the source system to the units in the destination system. Depending on the source system and destination system, you might not be able to change the Unit and Layout scale parameters. By using the Resizing factor , however, you can always adjust the units.\n\n168 Basics Allplan 2020 Modifying objects generally To edit and copy elements or element groups in their entirety, you can use the Central move handle and the context toolbar . Modifying objects individually When you select a single element (for example, a rectangle, circle or wall), the program presents not only the handles but also the most important geometric parameters. By changing the values, you can directly modify the geometry of the element.",

Click the element. Select several elements or regions. Open the Brackets , click the elements or specify the regions. Then close the brackets. You can also open and close these metaphorical brackets by right-clicking in the workspace. Select elements in a region. To specify a selection rectangle: Use the left mouse button to open a selection rectangle. In the Optio ns - Desktop environment - Selection page - Selection area, you can specify that closing the selection rectangle requires a second click. When working with the selection rectangle, you can specify whether you want to select elements fully bounded by the region, fully bounded and intersected or intersected elements only. To specify a fence : Click Fence and enter the points defining the outline of the fence. Select all elements. In the case of some tools (for example, Export ), you can select all the elements in the current document by clicking All in the input options. This also selects elements that are not visible such as default reference planes. See also \"Behavior of default planes when copying or moving elements between documents\" in the Allplan Help. Reselect the elements that were selected last. Click Reselect (Actionbar – Work Environment area or Filter Assistant toolbar). Select elements with the same group number. Click one of the elements in the group with the middle mouse button and then left mouse button. Alternatively, select and hold the Shift key.\n\nInstallation, Basics Structuring and managing data 227 Creating a building structure You can create a building structure in several ways: • You can create the building structure by using floor manager. If you use this method, you can create the building structure and the objects derived from the building structure in one go. At the same time, you can assign height settings to the structural levels. • You can configure the program to create the building structure automatically the first time you open the Building structure tab. If you use this method, you can select a building structure that comes with Allplan. • You can create the building structure by using the building structure wizard. Using structural levels to apply a logical structure to a building By means of structural levels, you can apply a logical structure to a building. You can assign one or more drawing files to each structural level. There are two different types of structural levels: • Predefined structural levels : Predefined structural levels can only be used in their hierarchical sequence. For example, a structure cannot be subordinate to a building. However, structural levels can be left out (for example, a building can be subordinate to a project). The following five predefined structural levels are available (in this hierarchy): - Site - Structure - Building - Story - Substory • Any structural levels : in addition, you can use custom structural levels, which you can insert anywhere in the building structure. Click Restrictions of building structure on the shortcut menu of a project to specify which structural levels can be used in the building structure and which structural levels can be assigned drawing files.",

The input options provide numerous tools that help you place elements. Note : You cannot use the clipboard when you define patterns and fonts. Allplan features You can use the clipboard in Allplan just as you would in any other Windows application. Note, however, that there are some special elements and properties: • Layer : Elements retain their layers. Elements on frozen layers (visible and hidden) will not be copied. • Default planes : You must use Ctrl+A to select default planes. See also \"Behavior of default planes when copying or moving elements between documents\" in the Allplan Help. • Group number : Elements get new group numbers when you place them. Elements that had the same group numbers still have the same group numbers. • Document size : The program displays an error message if the file size is too large after you have inserted elements. • Texts : If the application from which you have copied texts to the clipboard is an OLE server (such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel), the contents of the clipboard will be pasted as an OLE object into Allplan.

In Allplan you usually select the edit tool (for example, copy) first and then the elements to which you want to apply this tool. This also works the other way round in most edit tools: Select the elements first and then the tool. You can select elements either by clicking them or by defining a region around the elements you want to select. The tools in the Work Environment area of the Actionbar , the selection shortcut menu and the Filter Assistant toolbar help you select elements. Tip: When you right-click an element and select an edit tool on the shortcut menu, Allplan selects the element automatically.\n\nInstallation, Basics Basic approach 97 Correcting errors When you make an error in Allplan, you can use Undo (Quick Access Toolbar ) to correct the error. The number of undo steps is unlimited. For example, if you inadvertently moved an element, you can annul the move. You can go back (undo) as many steps as you want, as far back as the last time the data was saved. Note that certain actions, such as switching between drawing files or switching to Layout Editor , make Allplan save the data automatically. You can undo several steps in one go. Click the arrow beside the Undo icon and drag the cursor over all the steps you want to undo. Then release the mouse button. Redo redoes operations that you have undone. Redo operations, however, are not possible if you have added new design entities in the meantime. Note : You can also activate Undo while another tool is active. The tool in question will close and all the entries you made while it was active are undone. Tip: If you inadvertently deleted elements, you can quickly restore them by immediately right-clicking in the workspace twice (the Delete tool must still be active).",

A wizard is a pictogram-like legend representing tools you use frequently. In addition, you can use wizards to work with predefined content. You can match all attributes and parameters of elements from the wizard. You do not need to define any element properties. Right -clicking an element opens a shortcut menu with the following options: • The tool that was used to create the element is at the top of the shortcut menu. The element gets the most recent properties; it does not take the parameters and attributes from the wizard. • By clicking Match , you open the tool that was used to create the element. In addition, you take all the parameters and attributes from the wizard. This is equivalent to double-clicking the element with the right mouse button. • Conversion for Building Alteration Work is available for most architectural elements. This matches the building alteration category of the element clicked. If you have not assigned a building alteration category, Allplan automatically uses the New building category. Allplan comes with several predefined wizard files, but you can also create your own wizards. You can find the predefined wizards in the \\ETC\\Assistent folder. In addition, you can purchase wizards with content. • You can save drawing files and NDW files as wizards.

The export log sorts elements that cannot be transferred by problem category and IFC object type, listing the elements with the Name and Allright_Component_ID attributes. Note: The Export IFC Data tools considers the visibility settings of layers . If, for example, you want to transfer the load-bearing layer of a wall to IFC, hide the Allplan layers of all other wall layers before you export the data.

Then, move the data toward the origin by using the Move tool in Allplan. • Define offset coordinates in the Project Settings . Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. Important Using an offset is usually the better solution: • Point coordinates are measured correctly, and they do not change. This is particularly important when you need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). • Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. • Whenever you move data, you change the coordinates themselves. Use this option only if you want to work with this data only in your office and you do not need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). If a project with large coordinates is at an advanced stage, Allplan provides another solution that helps you enhance the representation of this data. • Open the Options on the Desktop environment page and select the Optimize working with large coordinates option. Allplan optimizes the coordinates of the elements internally, restoring the original values each time you save the data, for example. Adjusting units and lengths During conversion, you can use three parameters to control how the program adjusts the units in the source system to the units in the destination system. Depending on the source system and destination system, you might not be able to change the Unit and Layout scale parameters. By using the Resizing factor , however, you can always adjust the units.\n\n268 IFC interface Allplan 2020 IFC object type You can use the IFC object type (IfcObjectType) attribute to change the IFC classification of components. This is particularly important if you cannot find an appropriate Allplan tool to create a component and thus model the component as a 3D object or a user-defined architectural component. Note: Only use the IFC object type attribute if you need it. IFC object type exports the element as a BREP (surface model). Normally, Allplan elements will be assigned automatically to the appropriate IFC classes (walls, columns, .). If the IFC object type assigned matches the native Allplan element type, the program ignores the assignment, trying to transfer the element not as a BRep. This prevents loss of quality during IFC export. Note: IFC export transfers openings in the following components: wall (IfcWall), downstand beam and upstand beam (IfcBeam), column (IfcColumn), slab (IfcSlab), roof (IfcRoof), foundation (IfcFooting), and BuildingElementProxy. If a different IFC object type is assigned to the component (for example, IfcPlate instead of IfcSlab), openings will not be transferred. Use the Modify Attributes tool to assign the IFC object type (IfcObjectType) attribute to this component and select the appropriate IFC classification afterward. The most commonly used 21 IFC elements are predefined and can be selected directly in the drop-down list. If you cannot find the required element, click any entry and enter the name of the missing element at the keyboard. The program saves the new entry, presenting it again the next time you select attributes. You can find detailed information on all IFC object types and IFC object subtypes in the appendix of the Allplan BIM compendium, which you can download as a PDF file from the Allplan home page (http://www.allplan.com/en).

The grid serves as a means of visual orientation, as well as for point snapping. The grid points themselves do not appear in printouts. When the Grid point option is selected in the Point snap area of the Point snap options , you can use the grid points as snap points. If you clear all the other check boxes and turn off point snap in all drawing files, the cursor will snap to grid points only. Note : Grid points are snapped even when the grid is not visible. Use Grid on/off to show and hide the grid. Use Grid Settings (View menu or View drop-down list on the Quick Access Toolbar ) to define the spacing between grid points in the x-direction and y- direction. When creating the grid, the program takes the current system angle into account.\n\n148 Basics Allplan 2020 Before you place the point, you can also point to another point: the offset you enter in the dialog line refers to the new point snapped.

Then, move the data toward the origin by using the Move tool in Allplan. • Define offset coordinates in the Project Settings . Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. Important Using an offset is usually the better solution: • Point coordinates are measured correctly, and they do not change. This is particularly important when you need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). • Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. • Whenever you move data, you change the coordinates themselves. Use this option only if you want to work with this data only in your office and you do not need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). If a project with large coordinates is at an advanced stage, Allplan provides another solution that helps you enhance the representation of this data. • Open the Options on the Desktop environment page and select the Optimize working with large coordinates option. Allplan optimizes the coordinates of the elements internally, restoring the original values each time you save the data, for example. Adjusting units and lengths During conversion, you can use three parameters to control how the program adjusts the units in the source system to the units in the destination system. Depending on the source system and destination system, you might not be able to change the Unit and Layout scale parameters. By using the Resizing factor , however, you can always adjust the units.",

        "context": "292 Sequence in which elements print Allplan 2020 Note : Display on the screen and PDF export consider the display sequence of elements. Documents placed get a value of -13, which cannot be changed. Consequently, documents placed in a layout cover elements with a display sequence of -14 and 15, which are placed directly in the layout. The Surface elements in background and Surface elements in background of each document options do not affect elements placed directly in layouts. Settings at the printer The settings vary depending on the printer you use (for example, HP, Océ). Please refer to the documentation that came with your printer. To optimize the results, you might have to change the settings several times. Example (HP DesignJet 650C): Pen parameters - Overlay Example (HP DesignJet 800): Setup menu - HP-GL/2 setting - Overlay • Off: (default setting): Elements hide one another in accordance with rules 1-3. • On: Elements blend (fills will become mixed colors; lines will be visible in fills).

Example (Océ 9700, Job Director): Data format - Language - specific settings - Controller • Overlay : Elements hide one another in accordance with rules 1-3. • Blend : Elements blend (fills will become mixed colors; lines will be visible in fills). Rules 1-3 do not apply! Settings you can make for the Windows driver Most Windows drivers (for example, for HP DesignJet 650C) automatically deactivate certain printer settings (for example, the Overlay function). In most cases, you cannot use the driver to control these functions. Use output channels instead.\n\nInstallation, Basics Layouts and printing 275 Layouts and printing Output options Allplan 2020 provides two options for printing data: • You can use Print and Quick Print to print results at any time. Often, you want to have the current edit status on paper without having to assemble a layout first. Thus, you can also print details or sections of floor plans. To create the printout, Allplan uses the settings (for example, margins, header, footer, construction lines) defined in Print Preview . You can also define the scale and the section of the printout. In addition, you can set up the printer. If you want to print the contents of the active viewport without defining print settings beforehand, select the Quick Print tool in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File menu. The print job will immediately be sent to the printer specified in print preview. If you want to select the printer, click Print in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File menu. • You create the finished layouts with the tools in the Layout Editor task. You define the sheet size and scope of the layout and place the layout border and title block. You can use print sets to control what is printed. When printing layouts, you can select the elements to be printed and the output device.\n\n290 Sequence in which elements print Allplan 2020 Sequence in which elements print You need to distinguish between the sequence in which elements within a document print and the sequence in which documents and other elements in a layout print. The settings you make for the printer or the Windows driver also affect the sequence. Printing sequence within a document • Sequence in which elements are created or modified: By default, elements are drawn based on the sequence in which they were created or modified. The element you created or modified most recently is always on top, hiding the other elements with the same sequence value. • Display sequence: You can define the display sequence of elements by entering a value between -15 and +16. The elements appear on the screen in accordance with the value set: The greater the value, the further up the element. In other words, the element with the greatest value is on top of all the other elements. If several elements have the same value, the display sequence depends on the sequence in which the elements were created or modified. You can generally place surface elements in the background. New elements are given fixed default values, which you can define in the Options - Desktop environment page - General area - Sequence defaults button. You can modify these values. To do this, right-click an element and choose Format Properties - Sequence on the shortcut menu. As an alternative, select Modify Format Properties - Sequence in the Change task area. Elements from V2003 with the Always on Top format property get the value +12. • Surface elements (hatching, patterns, fills, bitmap areas, OLE elements, XRefs): You can specify whether surface elements behave like other elements (that is, printing based on creation sequence or display sequence) or whether they are to stay in the background. In the latter case, the creation sequence or display sequence defined controls only the sequence of the surface elements Tip: To bring an element to the top: Move the element and specify the same point for from point and to point . Allplan then ‘re-creates’ the element, placing it on top of the other elements.",

When printing in batch mode, you can use a fixed print profile for all the layouts or you can use the print profiles saved with the individual layouts. In this case, you can make temporary changes in the print profile of the current layout. Allplan uses the global settings for layouts without print profiles. The print profile you select in the Export PDF Data tool has a higher priority rating than the print profiles saved with the layouts; therefore, this print profile is used for all the PDF files that are created in batch mode. Allplan saves the print profile to the favorite file so that you can also use the print profile in Allplan Exchange Layout Distribution . Printing in batch mode When you have selected several layouts for printing in the Print Layouts tool, these layouts will be printed in batch mode. If a Windows driver is selected for the current layout, you can specify the output device, paper format and print profile you want to use. Thus, you can send some layouts straight to a printer and create print files for the other layouts. If you have selected an Allplan vector driver in the current layout, the program uses this driver to print all the layouts that are part of the batch.

You can apply the changes by selecting Update drawing file on the shortcut menu. In the Options - Desktop environment page, you can configure the program to inform you of changes in reference drawing files. 9 Linked drawing file The drawing file contains model data or views and sections linked with other drawing files. Allplan links drawing files when you create views and sections with the tools in the Reinforcement Views task area. You can use the shortcut menu to list all reference drawing files of the current drawing file or open its reference drawing files in edit or reference mode. 10 Views and sections created automatically The drawing file contains views and sections that you created by using the shortcut menu in the “Derived from building structure” area or views and sections that you created with the tools in the Sections task area of which the results were saved in this drawing file. These views and sections usually refer to other drawing files. Allplan considers the model data in these drawing files. 11 Update locked By using the shortcut menu in the \"Derived from building structure\" area, you can lock the update of drawing files with views and sections created with the Update automatically option not being selected. Allplan cannot update the result until the drawing file is unlocked or the Update automatically option is selected. After having confirmed a prompt, you can create a new view or section in the drawing file. 12 Views and sections placed manually The drawing file contains views and sections created with the tools in the Sections task area. These views and sections can refer to other drawing files. Allplan considers the model data in these drawing files.\n\nInstallation, Basics Structuring and managing data 221 Drawing file status With the drawing file status, you define the drawing file on which you draw and which drawing files are visible and can be modified. The following illustration shows the different drawing file statuses. You can find an explanation in the table. Number Drawing file status Comment 1 Current or active The current or active drawing file is the one in which you draw. There must always be one current or active drawing file. 2 Open in edit mode Elements in drawing files open in edit mode are visible and can be modified. Up to 128 drawing files can be open simultaneously (regardless of whether they are current, in edit mode or in reference mode). 3 Open in reference mode Elements in drawing files open in reference mode are visible, but they cannot be modified. You can configure the program to use the same color for all elements in reference drawing files. To do this, select the Options , click Desktop environment and open the Display page. You cannot open empty drawing files in reference mode. 4 Not selected Elements in these drawing files are not visible. 5 Empty Empty drawing files have no data type icon. 6 Assigned temporarily The drawing file is assigned temporarily to the fileset. Allplan clears this assignment as soon as you switch to a different fileset.\n\n168 Basics Allplan 2020 Modifying objects generally To edit and copy elements or element groups in their entirety, you can use the Central move handle and the context toolbar . Modifying objects individually When you select a single element (for example, a rectangle, circle or wall), the program presents not only the handles but also the most important geometric parameters. By changing the values, you can directly modify the geometry of the element.",

Additionally, the linked program must be an OLE server program, such as many Microsoft Office programs, in order to provide OLE objects for embedding.",
        "context": "Installation, Basics Using OLE objects 207 Using OLE objects Using OLE objects By means of the OLE technology, you can link and embed objects and thus exchange information between different applications. Data from a source document (for example, Microsoft® Word) is associated with or embedded in an Allplan document. When you select the embedded data, the original application opens, and you can edit the data in the source document. The following object types can be embedded in Allplan (depending on the applications you have installed): • Excel files (.xls, xlsx) • Word files (.doc, .docx) • RTF files (.rtf) • PowerPoint files (.ppt, pptx) • Bitmaps (for example, .bmp, .jpg) The linked program must be an OLE server program (such as many Microsoft Office programs). Otherwise, the linked program cannot provide OLE objects.\n\n208 Linking and embedding OLE objects Allplan 2020 Linking and embedding OLE objects You can insert OLE objects in Allplan in two ways. The difference lies in the way Allplan saves the objects: Linking objects When objects are linked with Allplan, the Allplan document is linked with the object in question. When the object changes, you can manually update the link in Allplan. Double-clicking the linked object in Allplan opens it in its original application and you can edit it as usual. You must not change the paths to the source document and to the original application. When you rename either one, you must create the link again. Embedding objects When objects are embedded in Allplan, a copy of the source document is placed in the Allplan document. After you have inserted this copy, it is no longer linked to the source document. In other words, the program cannot update the Allplan document to reflect any changes you make to the source document. Embedded objects can be edited either in Allplan or in their original application; but any changes you make to the object have no effect on the source document.\n\nInstallation, Basics Using OLE objects 209 Transparency of OLE objects The background of OLE objects can only be transparent or not transparent; the default setting is transparent. Transparent background means that you can see the Allplan background color instead of the background color of the OLE object. Therefore, turn off transparency when you use a black background in Allplan and the OLE object you have embedded is a Word document with black text, for example. Editing OLE objects Double-clicking an OLE object opens it in its original application and you can edit it as usual. You can also open and edit objects linked with Allplan directly in the original application and then update them in Allplan. All you have to do is double-click these objects and edit them. Just double-click these objects and edit them. Embedded objects can be edited either in Allplan or in their original application; but any changes you make to the object have no effect on the source document. You can use Allplan tools such as Copy, Move, and so on to edit OLE objects. To change the size of OLE objects, use the Resize tool.",

The next time you load the layout, the settings saved to the print profile will be used again. When printing in batch mode, you can use a fixed print profile for all the layouts or you can use the print profiles saved with the individual layouts. In this case, you can make temporary changes in the print profile of the current layout. Allplan uses the global settings for layouts without print profiles. The print profile you select in the Export PDF Data tool has a higher priority rating than the print profiles saved with the layouts; therefore, this print profile is used for all the PDF files that are created in batch mode. Allplan saves the print profile to the favorite file so that you can also use the print profile in Allplan Exchange Layout Distribution . Printing in batch mode When you have selected several layouts for printing in the Print Layouts tool, these layouts will be printed in batch mode. If a Windows driver is selected for the current layout, you can specify the output device, paper format and print profile you want to use. Thus, you can send some layouts straight to a printer and create print files for the other layouts. If you have selected an Allplan vector driver in the current layout, the program uses this driver to print all the layouts that are part of the batch. Depending on the selected setting, all layouts are sent straight to the printer or several print files are created. Printing several layouts with Windows drivers (batch mode) As opposed to printing in batch mode with Allplan vector drivers, you can specify the output device, paper format and print profile for the selected layouts when you use Windows drivers.
