    "question": "How can I control the height of a pattern element in the layout to be a specific size, independent of the drawing scale, in Allplan 2020?",
    "answer": "To control the pattern element height independently of drawing scale, select **Constant in layout** in the pattern parameters, then adjust the height factor value to achieve your desired size in the layout.",

You can define these values in the pattern defaults (on the **Tools** menu – **Defaults** – **Pattern**).\n\n* The **Adjust to scale in layout** and **Constant in layout** resizing options.

It is the way hatching looks in layouts that is of relevance.",
    "groundedness_score": 4,
    "groundedness_eval": "The answer is mostly supported by the context. It correctly identifies that selecting Constant in layout makes pattern elements a constant size in layouts regardless of scale, which is directly stated in the context. However, the context does not explicitly confirm that adjusting the height factor value is the method to achieve a specific desired size - it only mentions that height factor values can be entered in pattern parameters. The answer makes a reasonable inference but adds a step not explicitly detailed in the provided context.",

    "question_relevancy_eval": "This question is highly relevant to Allplan 2020 users working with layouts and pattern elements. It addresses a specific technical challenge that professionals encounter when managing drawing scales and layout presentations. Understanding how to control pattern element heights independently of drawing scale is important for maintaining consistent visual presentations across different scaled drawings, which is a common workflow in architectural and engineering design. The question demonstrates domain-specific knowledge and would provide valuable practical guidance to professionals.",
    "faithfulness_score": 5,
    "faithfulness_eval": "The answer is completely faithful to the context. It accurately states that selecting Constant in layout keeps pattern elements at a constant size in layouts regardless of scale, and correctly identifies that the height factor value can be adjusted to control the desired size.

You should assign privilege sets if several people work on the same project. With workgroup manager, you can assign individual users to one or more privilege sets. As a result, these users can see or edit only the layers that are associated with the relevant privilege set. Privilege sets can do more than just control who accesses which layers. They simplify your whole work, as you can define privilege sets with a selection of layers that are to be available while drawing. After installation, the \\*\\*ALLPLAN\\*\\* privilege set is preset. This privilege set has read/write permissions for all layers. Consequently, all users can see and modify all data.",

The element you created or modified most recently is always on top, hiding the other elements with the same sequence value.\n\n**Tip:** To bring an element to the top: Move the element and specify the same point for **from point** and **to point**. Allplan then 're-creates' the element, placing it on top of the other elements.\n\n* **Display sequence:** You can define the display sequence of elements by entering a value between -15 and +16. The elements appear on the screen in accordance with the value set: The greater the value, the further up the element. In other words, the element with the greatest value is on top of all the other elements. If several elements have the same value, the display sequence depends on the sequence in which the elements were created or modified. You can generally place surface elements in the background.\n\nNew elements are given fixed default values, which you can define in the **Options - Desktop environment** page - **General** area - **Sequence defaults** button. You can modify these values. To do this, right-click an element and choose **Format Properties - Sequence** on the shortcut menu. As an alternative, select **Modify Format Properties - Sequence** in the **Change** task area.\n\nElements from V2003 with the **Always on Top** format property get the value **+12**.\n\n* **Surface elements (hatching, patterns, fills, bitmap areas, OLE elements, XRefs):** You can specify whether surface elements behave like other elements (that is, printing based on creation sequence or display sequence) or whether they are to stay in the background.\n\nIn the latter case, the creation sequence or display sequence defined controls only the sequence of the surface elements",

The difference lies in the way Allplan saves the objects:\n\n## Linking objects\n\nWhen objects are linked with Allplan, the Allplan document is linked with the object in question. When the object changes, you can manually update the link in Allplan. Double-clicking the linked object in Allplan opens it in its original application and you can edit it as usual. You must not change the paths to the source document and to the original application. When you rename either one, you must create the link again.\n\n## Embedding objects\n\nWhen objects are embedded in Allplan, a copy of the source document is placed in the Allplan document. After you have inserted this copy, it is no longer linked to the source document. In other words, the program cannot update the Allplan document to reflect any changes you make to the source document.

The difference lies in the way Allplan saves the objects:\n\n## Linking objects\n\nWhen objects are linked with Allplan, the Allplan document is linked with the object in question. When the object changes, you can manually update the link in Allplan. Double-clicking the linked object in Allplan opens it in its original application and you can edit it as usual. You must not change the paths to the source document and to the original application. When you rename either one, you must create the link again.\n\n## Embedding objects\n\nWhen objects are embedded in Allplan, a copy of the source document is placed in the Allplan document. After you have inserted this copy, it is no longer linked to the source document. In other words, the program cannot update the Allplan document to reflect any changes you make to the source document. Embedded objects can be edited either in Allplan or in their original application; but any changes you make to the object have no effect on the source document.",

    "answer": "To assign the IFC object type attribute to a component, use the **Modify Attributes** tool, then select the appropriate IFC classification from the drop-down list. If the required element isn't available, click any entry and type the missing element name at the keyboard.",
    "location_dependency_evaluator_target_answer": "To assign the IFC object type attribute to a component, use the **Modify Attributes** tool, then select the appropriate IFC classification from the drop-down list.

This is particularly important if you cannot find an appropriate Allplan tool to create a component and thus model the component as a 3D object or a user-defined architectural component.\n\n**Note:** Only use the **IFC object type** attribute if you need it. **IFC object type** exports the element as a BREP (surface model). Normally, Allplan elements will be assigned automatically to the appropriate IFC classes (walls, columns, ...). If the **IFC object type** assigned matches the native Allplan element type, the program ignores the assignment, trying to transfer the element not as a BRep. This prevents loss of quality during IFC export.\n\n**Note:** IFC export transfers openings in the following components: wall (IfcWall), downstand beam and upstand beam (IfcBeam), column (IfcColumn), slab (IfcSlab), roof (IfcRoof), foundation (IfcFooting), and BuildingElementProxy. If a different **IFC object type** is assigned to the component (for example, IfcPlate instead of IfcSlab), openings will not be transferred.\n\nUse the **Modify Attributes** tool to assign the **IFC object type** (`IfcObjectType`) attribute to this component and select the appropriate IFC classification afterward.\n\nThe most commonly used 21 IFC elements are predefined and can be selected directly in the drop-down list. If you cannot find the required element, click any entry and enter the name of the missing element at the keyboard. The program saves the new entry, presenting it again the next time you select attributes.\n\nYou can find detailed information on all **IFC object types** and **IFC object subtypes** in the appendix of the Allplan BIM compendium, which you can download as a PDF file from the Allplan home page (http://www.allplan.com/en).\n\nAssigning IFC object type or IFC object subtype",
